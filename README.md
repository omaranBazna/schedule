# How to use GitHub for team management

*Make sure all team members have access to the repo and are added as collaborators. You can add people directly when creating the repo or invite them later.
*Use GitHub issues to track tasks, bugs, ideas, etc. Issues are a great way for team members to communicate and collaborate.
*Use pull requests for code reviews. Require team members to submit PRs rather than pushing directly to master. This allows you to review code changes before they are merged.
*Communicate frequently as a team on progress, what's next, blockers, etc. GitHub facilitates transparency.

# Working rules:

## Process steps: 

1- Every sprint I will open a set of issues for the sprint, along with a brief description <br><br>
2- Everyone should select one issue at a time after you select the issue, you create a new branch with the name [issuename-yourname] <br><br>
3- Once you create the branch, pull the repo branch into your local Visual Code Editor <br><br>
4- Once you pull it, you make the changes, and once done you push the changes into the branch again <br><br>
5- Once pushing it, you make a pull request to the correct branch <br><br>
6- I will review the pull request, then we start having a conversation in the pull request conversation and I will request some changes <br><br>
7- You do the changes on your local Visual Code Editor <br><br>
8- push the changes again and so on <br><br>
9- I will accept the "pull request" so the branch will be merged into the target branch <br><br>
10- We keep doing this until all sprint issues are resolved <br>


## General rules:

1- make sure to read the issue description carefully  <br><br>
2- you are allowed to create issues if you think there is something missing   <br><br>
3- Create a new branch before you make any single change <br><br>
4- Make sure to push your work in small changes rather than doing all of it in one large change <br><br>
5- Our Communication should be as much as possible through GitHub so that we document every single thing in time  <br><br>
6- Add a clear description to anything you do 
7- Choose a good and descriptive names / titles for you branches names, pull requests titles
8- Feel free to send me a whatsapp message and I will respond as soon as I can
