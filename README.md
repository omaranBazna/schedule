# How to use GitHub for team management

1- Make sure all team members have access to the repo and are added as collaborators. You can add people directly when creating the repo or invite them later.<br><br>
2- Use GitHub issues to track tasks, bugs, ideas, etc. Issues are a great way for team members to communicate and collaborate.<br><br>
3- Use pull requests for code reviews. Require team members to submit PRs rather than pushing directly to master. This allows you to review code changes before they are merged.<br><br>
4- Communicate frequently as a team on progress, what's next, blockers, etc. GitHub facilitates transparency.<br><br>

# Working rule:
## Process steps: 

1- Every sprint I will open a set of issues for the sprint, along with a brief description <br><br>
2- Everyone should select issues evenly at a time after you select the issue <br><br>
3- Once you create the branch, pull the repo correct branch into your local Visual Code Editor <br><br>
4- After pulling it, create a new branch with the name [issuename-yourname]<br><br>
5- Publish the branch to the GitHub repo
6- Made the required changes
5- Push the changes with a good commit message
6- Go to the GitHub repo and choose the new branch <br><br>
7- Make a pull request from the new branch into the correct branch(suitable branch for the issue)
7- I will review the pull request, then we start having a conversation in the pull request conversation and I will request some changes <br><br>
8- You do the changes on your local Visual Code Editor <br><br>
9- push the changes again and make a new pull request and so on until I accept it <br><br>
10- I will accept the "pull request" so the branch will be merged into the target branch <br><br>
11- We keep doing this until all sprint issues are resolved <br>


## General rules:

1- make sure to read the issue description carefully  <br><br>
2- you are allowed to create issues if you think there is something missing   <br><br>
3- Create a new branch before you make changes <br><br>
4- Make sure to push your work in small changes rather than doing all of it in one large change <br><br>
5- Our Communication should be as much as possible through GitHub so that we document every single thing in time  <br><br>
6- <strong>Add a clear description to anything you do</strong> <br><br>
7- <strong>Choose good and descriptive names/titles for your branches' names, pull request titles</strong> <br><br>
8- Try to use editable versions of your work (for example word document instead of pdf)
9- Feel free to send me a WhatsApp message and I will respond as soon as I can  <br><br>
